			"value": "\\n Electricity is a powerful mechanism in the game that can be used to control behavior of certain blocks.\\n For example, a lightbulb will produce light when connected to a source of electricity, doors will open or close if activated with an electric signal, and many more.\\n \\n\\n\\n If you know a bit about real-world electronics, you should feel at home in Survivalcraft.\\n All the familiar devices, such as logic gates (AND, OR, NOT etc.) are present and signals are characterized by voltage.\\n You can combine gates to build complex circuits, even computers or video games (check Community Content for some great builds by master electricians).\\n There are also sensors, such as pressure plates, photodiodes etc. that produce varying signals depending on conditions around them.\\n \\n\\n\\n For descriptions of all available electric devices, see RECIPAEDIA.\\n \\n\\n\\n Electric signals in the game are conducted through copper wires and have a voltage that is between 0V and 1.5V, in increments of 0.1V.\\n This gives 16 distinct voltage values.\\n \\n\\n\\n Digital devices, such as buttons, switches or doors work only with digital signals that have two possible values: low (0, false, off, no) and high (1, true, on, yes).\\n In this case, a voltage below 0.8V indicates low, 0.8V and greater indicates high.\\n Most commonly digital signals have voltages of 0V for low and 1.5V for high, but any value below 0.8V will be read as low.\\n \\n\\n\\n Analog devices, such as pressure plates, motion detectors or lightbulbs work with analog signals.\\n They will react to each different value of voltage between 0 and 1.5V, not just low and high states.\\n For example, sound generator volume and pitch inputs are controlled by analog voltages.\\n The volume and pitch will increase smoothly as the voltages get higher.\\n \\n\\n\\n It's good to remember that both analog and digital signals are really the same thing when conducted through the wire, a voltage between 0V and 1.5V.\\n Only the way a device interprets the signals voltage determines whether it is digital or analog.\\n \\n\\n\\n Voltage can also be interpreted as a number, with 0V representing 0 and 1.5V representing 15.\\n Some devices, such as displays, DAC\/ADC converters or counters use this interpretation.\\n \\n\\n\\n All electric devices have connections (inputs and outputs) on their sides, and sometimes also on their back (the face attached to the wall).\\n On complex devices these are indicated by blue and red dots on edges of the elements.\\n Blue means input, red means output.\\n Number of dots means number of the connection.\\n Simple devices, such as buttons, switches or lightbulbs do not have these dots, because they use one input\/output only and can be connected from any side.\\n \\n\\n\\n Electric devices can be placed on the walls and on the floor\/ceiling (with some exceptions).\\n Once placed, they can be rotated so that it's easy to connect appropriate inputs and outputs together with the wires.\\n \\n\\n\\n There is a special type of block in the game, called wire-though-block, which is a normal block with a hole drilled and an electric wire threaded though it.\\n It is very useful when trying to hide wires from sight, run them though the wall, or prevent them from connecting with other wires.\\n It is also the only way to access the \"back\" connection of devices which have it.\\n \\n\\n\\n Electricity in Survivalcraft is processed at a frequency of 100Hz.\\n It means that voltage goes from one element to another in 0.01s, irrespective of the length of the wire.\\n If you need to delay the signal, you may place some neutral elements in its path (for example an OR gate or a pair of NOT gates).\\n Each additional element in the way of the signal will delay it by 0.01s.\\n For longer delays use Adjustable Delay Gate, which can produce delays of up to 2.55s.\\n \\n\\n\\n Electricity is a complex topic and making large working machines requires some learning, but is very satisfying.\\n Simple devices however can be constructed by anyone.\\n For example, try placing a button next to the hinges of a door.\\n You will notice a wire appeared, clicking the button will now operate the door!\\n All this scary talk about voltages, signals, digital and analog, but in reality it's that simple.\\n \\n\\n\\n Another easy thing to build might be a light switch.\\n Place a lightbulb on the ceiling and a switch (not button) on the wall.\\n Then connect them with a wire.\\n The switch now operates the light, like in a real room!\\n \\n\\n\\n Survivalcraft is more about realism than other games of this type, and electricity is no exception.\\n What you learn here, might become invaluable when you get to learn this at school, or have to use it for living.\\n \\n\\n\\n Explore and have fun!\\n ",

			"value": "\\n In Survivalcraft you can design and use custom furniture blocks.\\n \\n\\n\\n Furniture blocks are sculpted from up to 16x16x16 smaller sub-blocks.\\n Sub-blocks within a single furniture block can be made of different materials and painted to different colors.\\n Through crafting, furniture blocks can be combined, made interactive or made to work with electricity.\\n Furniture designs can be combined into packs, shared between worlds and uploaded to Community Content.\\n \\n\\n\\n To design and create furniture use the hammer tool.\\n You need to build the design from regular blocks in the world and then use the hammer on the resulting structure to shrink it down.\\n Furniture design window will appear where you can tweak the design by moving it, rotating it and changing resolution (between 2x2x2 and 16x16x16).\\n Once you are happy with the design, you can commit it.\\n \\n\\n\\n In creative mode, the design will be turned into a single furniture block, and the source blocks from which the design was created will remain in the world.\\n In survival modes, the design will be turned into several copies of the furniture block (with number depending on resolution) and the source blocks will be consumed.\\n Furniture blocks can be placed in the world in 4 orientations, similar to e.g. a furnace or a ladder.\\n \\n\\n\\n Not every block can be used for furniture design.\\n For example, dirt or grass are ignored by the hammer tool.\\n Allowed materials include: planks, granite, basalt, sand, clay, cobblestone, stone bricks, sandstone, marble, bricks, coal, malachite, diamond, copper, iron, glass, carpet, torches, wicker lamps, water, magma.\\n Source blocks of the design can be painted or dyed to make the design more colorful.\\n Finished furniture can also be painted, this will cover any colors of the source blocks.\\n \\n\\n\\n Certain source blocks have special functions.\\n For example a torch\/lamp block will cause the furniture to have a fire attached to it in the place of the block.\\n The design will also emit light.\\n \\n\\n\\n You have to be careful when constructing furniture to avoid placing the design on a base made of allowed material (for example sand).\\n The hammer tool will not be able to distinguish between the blocks you placed and the base, and will try to incorporate base into the design.\\n This will likely cause \"design too large\" error, because the maximum size of a design in any dimension is 16 blocks.\\n \\n\\n\\n Once the furniture block has been created, you can use workbench to combine it with other blocks in various ways.\\n The following combinations are possible:\\n \\n\\n\\n * Combine multiple pieces of furniture into one to create interactive furniture.\\n Interactive furniture toggles between its constituing designs on click or on electric signal.\\n You can create opening doors, switchable lights, raising platforms etc.\\n Up to 9 pieces of furniture can be combined (max capacity of workbench).\\n \\n\\n\\n * Combine exactly one furniture design with an electric button to create a custom button.\\n The resulting furniture will act as a button.\\n \\n\\n\\n * Combine exactly two furniture designs with an electric switch to create a custom switch.\\n The resulting furniture will act as a switch, with two furniture pieces acting as two states of the switch.\\n \\n\\n\\n * Combine multiple pieces of furniture with an electric wire to create connected interactive furniture.\\n The furniture will work in the same way as interactive furniture, but toggling it will also toggle all neighboring pieces of connected interactive furniture.\\n You can create multi-block toggleable structures, for example large doors.\\n \\n\\n\\n In the furniture panel in creative inventory you can view and organize your furniture designs.\\n Create named furniture sets to categorize the designs.\\n The newly created designs are placed in \"Uncategorized\" set, which has a special function.\\n Any design in this set, which does not otherwise exist in the world (no items or placed blocks) will be automatically recycled.\\n Be careful and move valuable designs to named furniture sets to avoid accidentally losing them.\\n Each named furniture set can be turned into a furniture pack and exported from the world.\\n You can later import it to other worlds or upload to Dropbox\/SDcard and share with others.\\n Furniture packs can also be uploaded to community content.\\n \\n\\n\\n There are certain limitations to the furniture system:\\n \\n\\n\\n * A furniture block can be made from up to 16x16x16 sub-blocks.\\n \\n\\n\\n * The amount of geometry used for a single design cannot exceed 300 triangles (too complex designs with many nooks and crannies are not possible).\\n The game uses an intelligent tesselation algorithm that optimizes the geometry, so 300 triangles is plenty for even fairly complex designs, unless you really go over the top.\\n To reduce number of triangles, you can reduce number of small details, reduce number of painted blocks and fill up any internal holes in the design.\\n \\n\\n\\n * You can only have up to 1024 unique furniture designs in the world.\\n Every time you paint a furniture or combine it with others, you are creating new designs that count towards the total.\\n Unused designs (that do not exist in the world either as items or blocks, and are in the \"uncategorized\" set in the inventory) are automatically recycled.\\n ",
